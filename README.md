My final project for the course Object Oriented Python at Blekinge Tekniska HÃ¶gskolan.

The assignment was to create a Trie structure which has the following recursive methods (for example in suffix search not allowed to take out all words to an ordidnary python array and the loop through and compare the endings):

Add a word
Remove a word
Find a word
Count words stored in the Trie
Return all words in alphabetic order
Prefix search - return up to 10 words starting with the prefix sorted by frequency in descending order
Suffix search - return all words ending with suffix sorted by frequency in descending order
Correct spelling - if the searched string is a word, return the word. Otherwise, return all words that have same amount of letters with max one letter in a row does not match and the last letter must match. For example 'broan' would return 'arian','aryan','blown','brown','croon','crown','drown','frown','groan','groin','grown','organ','urban' etc..
